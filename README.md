# Forest Fire Mathematical Modelling

This project introduces a mathematically grounded two-stage framework for modeling forest fire behavior. Unlike conventional assumptions of exponential growth, this study reveals that:

- **Fire occurrence is a binomial ignition process**
- **Fire spread (burned area) is overdispersed**, requiring careful probabilistic modeling

The work blends machine learning with statistical theory to reflect the true generative nature of fire behavior.

> ⚠️ This is a **pure scientific study**. It proposes no interventions or simulations — only mathematically sound modeling.
